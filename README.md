# QUark Assembly Rewriting Kit

This is a tool for static instrumentation of RISC-V programs. It works on
relocatable object files (before the linker has run, but after the compiler).
The object files must contain full relocation information (all references to
program text must be expressed as relocations), which is the case for RISC-V
object files generated by GCC and LLVM.

The tool is currently in-progress and currently does not have a nice API for
writing instrumentation tools (a Lua-based API is planned for the future).

There is an example in the `example` folder that instruments a fibonacci
program to record how many times it executes a `ret` instruction.
